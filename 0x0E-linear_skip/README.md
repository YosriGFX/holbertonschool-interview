# 0x0E. Linear search in skip list
### 0. Linear search in a skip list
Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a  ***skip list***
